# The tag dokan-sshfs-0.6.0 (svn commit r181 "add Dokan SSHFS 0.6.0")contains
# only dokan-sshfs without anything else. Other revisions contain exactly the
# same source, but in a subdirectory dokan_sshfs.
# git diff -D -M100% dokan-sshfs-0.6.0^ dokan-sshfs-0.6.0 shows only the renames due to the
# directory change and the deletes of all the other files.
# Therefore we discard the contents of this commit and move the tag to the
# previous commit.
